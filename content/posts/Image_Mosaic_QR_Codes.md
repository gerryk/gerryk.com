One of the guys at;<a href=http://www.tog.ie/>tog</a>;mentioned in a recent post to the mailing list the idea of using a photo mosaic to make up a QR code, as opposed to the usual black on white that we see everywhere.

To see if it works, I created one, and it appears that it does. Not sure about the thresholds of size and contrast though, as this is just a proof of concept, rather than an exhaustive study.
