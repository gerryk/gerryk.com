I just got one of those 'we can SEO you to riches and fame' emails. Normally, I just ignore them, flag as spam so gmail recognises them in the future, and go about my day. This time, however, the brazen tone and apparently international presence of IMPACTFULSEO.COM caught my attention.

\nHi,
\n
\nI was on your website;<a href=http://www.gerryk.com/>www.gerryk.com</a>
\nand wanted to shoot you a quick note. I think I can make a few changes
\n(aesthetically and/or SEO - wise) to make your site convert more
\nvisitors into leads and to get it placed higher in the organic search
\nresults, for a few of the select terms.
\n
\nThis is NOT like one of those foreign emails you probably get in
\nyour inbox every day. Just to be upfront I have 3 agents that work with
\nme for development /SEO.
\n
\nI would just need to know which (if not
\nboth) services you're open to checking out information about, either web
\ndesign or SEO. Would you be open to seeing more brief info / quote for
\nwhat I would like to accomplish?
\n
\nRegards,

\nA bit of searching in Google Maps revealed his Australian address to be a restaurant, his UK address to be non-existent, and mis-spelled, and his US address to be the offices of one Cots Communications.
\n
\nHis website... a pretty shoddy affair for a company trading for 9 years is full of misspellings, and is located at a domain only registered since March 2013, so about 5 months, rather than the 9 years claimed.

\nA bit of googling for the domain name led to this site:;<a href=http://www.jimmo.org/another-dubious-seo-company-impactfulseo-com/>http://www.jimmo.org/another-dubious-seo-company-impactfulseo-com/</a>
\nAnother non-score for ImpactfulSEO, by the looks of it.
