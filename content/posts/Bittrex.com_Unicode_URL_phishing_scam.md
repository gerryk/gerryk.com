title: "Bittrex.com Unicode URL phishing scam"

68,I occasionally use Bittrex to trade cryptos and were it not for my password manager, I would probably have fallen victim to a pretty subtle phishing scam.. The scam relies on the fact that in the huge unicode character set, there are many glyphs that look very like standard the roman characters we are used to as far as URLs are concerned. Many browsers do not make any visual distinction either, so if a letter looks like an 'A' for example, only some digging will reveal that it is in fact another character entirely.

Compare this, the legitimate URL...

<img alt=legit url data-entity-type=file data-entity-uuid=3590823d-32ac-4b62-900a-6333c0a6ef3c src=/sites/default/files/inline-images/2017-10-10%20%285%29.png />

With this, the fake...

<img alt=fake url data-entity-type=file data-entity-uuid=be3d7884-047b-4a81-81ed-3af215aabdad src=/sites/default/files/inline-images/2017-10-10%20%284%29.png />

All looks OK at a glance, right? Even has a green 'site secure' SSL notification. However, notice what looks like a;little comma under the 'r'? This is an entirely different character, which means that we are not at bittrex.com, we are at a phishing site. A pretty clever one too, as it turns out.

I didn't actually notice this at first. I use a password manager, Lastpass, which has a browser plugin that fills in credentials on recognised sites. In this instance, though, it failed to fill anything, which got me thinking.

I opened the 'site information' window and saw the following cookie...

<img alt=cookie data-entity-type=file data-entity-uuid=bb761768-e7a8-46cc-a05f-f7b7f6cbe488 src=/sites/default/files/inline-images/2017-10-10%20%287%29.png />

I then remembered <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/19/phishing-url-trick-hackers>reading about Unicode URL hacks</a>, and looked closer at;the;URL only to notice the little comma. xn--bittex-eib.com is rendered as;bitt≈óex.com by the browser.

It seems that Google is returning an ad for this URL in its results for 'bittrex'.

<img alt=google results data-entity-type=file data-entity-uuid=d82bc09f-3a35-4031-a4ce-24876f2298fa src=/sites/default/files/inline-images/2017-10-10%20%2810%29.png />

Thankfully this is as far as the scam got with me, but others may be less lucky.

Password managers and 2FA are a good line of defense against this sort of attack.
