I will be conducting an Asterisk workshop on Thursday evening, August 19, 2010 as a part of Irish HackerSpaces week.;The workshop will cover installation of Asterisk (as Trixbox), connection to a SIP trunk provider, connection to an IAX peer, set up of SIP clients and configuration of some of the many features Asterisk offers.
We have selected Blueface as the trunk provider.;
TOG, in Dublin have an Asterisk server set up already, so we have decided to peer with them. This will enable us to make calls to them directly over IAX and will serve as a nice testbed for ideas.

091Labs is located at Exchange House in Fairgreen, Galway -;<a href=http://bit.ly/d1oZaH>http://bit.ly/d1oZaH</a>
