I;recently installed the <a href=http://acquia.com/>Acquia</a>;version of;<a href=http://drupal.org/>Drupal</a>. I'd heard <a href=http://buytaert.net/>Dries Buytaert</a>;being interviewed on the <a href=http://www.lullabot.com/>Lullabot</a> <a href=http://www.lullabot.com/podcast>Podcast</a>, and one of the topics was his new, enterprise level distribution of the Drupal CMS. The main differences are that Views, CCK and a bunch of other modules are included in the basic install. The Mollom spam filter is also included.
The thing that caught my eye, however, was the central monitoring system, or Dashboard. The idea of this is that all yout Drupal sites are registered with your Acquia dashboard, which gives you a centralised view of your sites' status. Information available includes version management, Cron status and a site heartbeat, giving an at-a-glance indicator or whether your sites are currently available.
Much as I'd like to include an Acquia subscription in further sites, I don't see customers (or;<em>my</em>;customers, at any rate) going for a further expense, so I think a future project to consider might be a Drupal module that provides similar functionality to Acquia. I hope Dries doesn't mind too much.
