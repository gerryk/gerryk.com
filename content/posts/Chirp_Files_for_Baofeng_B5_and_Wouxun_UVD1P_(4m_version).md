I have created image files for CHIRP for both the;<a href=http://www.miklor.com/UVB5/>Baofeng B5, VHF/UHF dual band HT</a>, and the<a href=http://cqhq.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/wouxun-kg-uvd1pl-review-worlds-1st-70144-mhz-dual-bander/>;Wouxun UVD1P 4m/2m dual Band HT;</a>with the Irish repeater&amp;internet gateway frequencies and where applicable, access tones. They also contain other frequencies that can be interesting to listen to, such as Marine VHF and PMR446.
\nTo use them, you will need;<a href=http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home>CHIRP</a>;and a;<a href=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0083H56MY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1>radio programming lead</a>, and of course, the files, which can be downloaded from these links:
