We (the <a href=http://galwayvhfgroup.blogspot.ie/>Galway VHF Group</a>) have a good many portable operations coming up this year, so, to supplement our portable HF antenna collection, I thought a 20m Moxon might be a nice project.
The only real expense was the 4 fibreglass fishing poles, but they ended up very cheap, even when you factor in postage from the UK.
The design was going to be based around a spreader made from a rectangle of 12mm ply, with 25mm dowel bolted on at the relevant angles.

Once this construction was complete, I needed to do a little tapering with a rasp to get the poles to fit snugly, and then we had the test fit...

The feedpoint was fabricated from a terminal block in a small box, mounted on another (scrap) piece of fibreglass pole, and cable-tied to the spreader.

A little bit of pruning and we are on the air!! First QSO was with Tom, KE9RY from Wisconsin, who gave our puny 5w signal from the FT817 a 5/2 report. Pop the champange!
For the record, the gentleman in the pink sweater is Liam, EI6GXB. I am not so sartorially challenged.
