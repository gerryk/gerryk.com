I have to be honest when I say that this does;<strong>not</strong>;inspire confidence. Neither the HSE, nor Eircom has shown themselves to be leading lights of security and disclosure, preferring a more reactive approach of spin in the face of obvious breaches and slips.
It remains to be seen how this plays out, but I, personally, am not expecting any major diversions from form.
