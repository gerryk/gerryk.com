This Christmas, my wonderful GF got me something I have wanted since I was a small boy, a telescope. A;<a href=http://www.opticalvision.co.uk/documents/64.pdf target=_blank>damn fine one</a>;too.
I have always fancied giving astrophotography a shot, so I got the requisite attachment to hook my;<a href=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond80/ target=_blank>D80</a>;up to the scope.
I tried many permutations of T-adaptor and ring to get a sharp image, but to no avail... or at least not in prime focus mode. I then tried projection mode, which requires inserting an eyepiece into the T-adaptor.;
This is the shot I got. 1/50 sec @ ISO400
