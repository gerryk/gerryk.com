The awesome <a href=https://www.insight-centre.org/users/myriam-leggieri>Myriam Leggieri</a> just posted on the 091 Labs message board that;<a href=http://railsgirls.com/galway>Rails Girls Galway</a>;will be happening again this year. I had such a good time last year that I have to put my name forward to help again this year.
Deadly. Can't wait!
