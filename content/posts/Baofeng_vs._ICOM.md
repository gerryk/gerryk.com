67,So, when you get a Spectrum Analyser, what do you do? Analyse spectra, of course.
\n
\nI have a number of HTs, among them, a Baofeng B5. Baofeng HTs are a little looked-down upon in the Ham community, which may to some extent be justified. They do offer a cheap route to getting on the air, but with questionable spectral purity, or so reports would have it.
\n
\nNow that I have a recently acquired Spectrum Analyser, a HP 8591A, I can do some testing of my own, rather than taking hearsay at face-value.
\n
\nThe HTs on the bench for this test are...
\n
\nBaofeng UV-B5
\n
\nWouxun UV-1DP
\n
\nICOM IC E90
\n
\nICOM V80E
\n
\nYaesu FT2D
\n
\nMy testing setup and methodology will be to put a 5W signal into a 50ohm dummy-load with a 40dB test-port which will be connected to the input of the spectrum analyser. In order to give a reasonable window onto the spectrum, the view will be centred on the 2nd harmonic of the transmitted signal, and the span set to 2x the 2nd harmonic, so for a 440MHz signal, the centre will be 880-MHz, and the spam set to 1600MHz.
