Yesterday, 17th March (St. Patrick's Day) was also the date of the first castle activation for;<a href=http://cashota-ireland.org/>CASHOTA-Ireland</a>. We chose this day for a number of reasons... it was likely that there would be many stations eager to talk to an Irish station, and it was the first day I would have available.
The castle to be activated was Oranmore Castle, resident of World War II Submarine Commander and twice circumnavigator of the world, Commander Bill King. This Castle was designated EI/001/C for the CASHOTA Award.

I spent the previous couple of days building an 80m dipole, a 40m dipole and a;<a href=http://gerryk.com/node/15>20m Moxon</a>;with some help from;<a href=http://www.liammartin.com/>Liam EI6GXB</a>.
I had recently acquired a 20' x 2' aluminium pole, and Mark, EI6GUB had fabricated a really nice drive-on plate, so we were fully kitted out for the operation.

I'm pleased to report that the event went very well indeed. I was, as I hoped, variously QRV on 80, 40 and 20.;
80 was not in the best of shape. Made about 8 good contacts over an hour and a bit. Much QRM and general noise hampered things somewhat.
40 was a different story... 30 odd contacts, many from G land, but also F, D, SQ and many more.;
20 yielded a bit of DX, giving contacts in Russia, Canada and the US, with the record in terms of distance being Vegas, baby.

Altogether a great day, made better by wonderful weather. Some visitors in the shape of EI6GUB, 6GXB, 5DD and our guest from D land, Udo DJ5UL, made things even more enjoyable.
