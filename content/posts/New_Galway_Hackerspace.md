Galway has a new HackerSpace.

Going by the name 091labs (from the dialling code for Galway, 091) a HackerSpace has recently become active in Galway in the West of Ireland. I have yet to visit, but am very excited that we finally have our very own HackerSpace...;
Further details from the 091labs site:;<a href=http://091labs.com/>http://091labs.com/</a>;or their twwiter feed:;<a href=http://twitter.com/091labs>http://twitter.com/091labs</a>

I look forward to visiting the labs soon.
Best of luck!!
