Finally, after freezing all Winter, I decided to do something a little more secure and warm about getting my various antenna feedlines into the shack. The previous attempt was so slipshod that I think the less said about it, the better, so we'll leave it there.
\nI had a few pieces of 12mm ply lying around, so after measuring the window (23.5 x 13.5) cut one to fit. A little bit of trimming, here and there and a bang with a hammer, and it was a snug a fit as you could ask for. I then drilled a few holes to take the 3 SO239 bulkhead feedthroughs I had gotten very cheaply off eBay. A also cut a rough slot for the 450 ohm twinlead and drilled a few 3mm holes for various other bits of wire. The Drake 2B does, after all, need its own antenna.
So, this is the result...
