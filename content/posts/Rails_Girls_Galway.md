<a href=http://railsgirls.com/>Rails Girls</a>;is an international initiative geared at encouraging more women to get involved in technology, and;<img src=http://readidea.com/magazines/issue6/articles/ad-railsgirls/img/railsgirls-sq.png />more specifically, software engineering and CS. It does this by teaching Webapp development through the medium of;<a href=http://rubyonrails.org/>Ruby on Rails</a>.
\n
\nI am a member at;<a href=http://091labs.com/>091 Labs, Galway's very own Hacker|Maker space</a>. I don't get the chance to actively participate in much these days, but still monitor the mailing lists. When I came across Myriam Leggieri's post to the list looking for mentors for an event she was putting together, I was immediately interested. When I saw it was using RoR, I was in. I am a big fan of the Ruby language... I enjoy its purity and consistency. I also really like Rails and how fun it is, while being capable of 'big' stuff too.
\n
\nSo... that was my first introduction to Rails Girls as a concept, and immediately I was taken by the enthusiasm shown by all involved... not just the mentors and others involved in making;<a href=http://railsgirls.com/galway>the Galway event</a>;happen, but worldwide. Since I would be doing one of the many presentations during the day, I got in touch with some others that had done similar presentations at their events in other cities. Straight away, they replied with words of encouragement and open permission to use material from their slidepacks. This movement is something that seems to bring out the best in community spirit, even though that community may be spread out across the world.
\n
\nOn the first day, we invited all of the participants to attend an 'install party', where we, the mentors, would assist the girls to get the Ruby on Rails framework set up on their computers, along with a good editor to assist in the code creation tasks of the following day. This was attended by a good many, filling the main room in DERI where the event was to take place, and I was immediately struck by the spectrum of women that were attending. They spanned the gamut from schoolgirls to retired ladies, and included tech professionals, the unemployed, students and housewives. The hardware brought along was similarly varied... Windows laptops, some newer, and some older... some Macbooks, a Linux laptop or two, and two full size 27 iMacs!
\n
\nOn the main day of the event, once again, I was blown away by the variety of women in attendance. To see such a hunger to learn in a traditionally male-centric subject was so refreshing, and gives hope for the future of the tech/IT sector.
\nThe day started out with a brief welcome from Myriam, followed by a short talk from local TD Frank Fahy. DERI's John Breslin then said a few encouraging words, after which I gave my presentation which was an overview of web-app development, with the Rails Girls Application used as a case-study. The next item was a workshop style presentation from Rails Girls veteran, Emily Castles, which really got the girls involved for the first time during the day. This was followed by a talk on Beginning Programming by Stefania Farrugia.
\nOnce this was over, the group convened to the Computer and Communication Museum also located in the DERI building. In amongst historical items, such as a DEC PDP-8, manufactured in Galway, and many items that brought a nostalgic tear to my eye (80's 8-bit micros!), the attendees and mentors had coffee and a chat, discussing the day so far, each others' backgrounds and the historical significance of the many items of hardware curated by Brendan Smith of DERI.
\n
\nThe 'main event' was to be a one-to-few mentored workshop, where one mentor would work with a small group of 4 or 5 girls to build, from scratch, a working web application. The application chosen for this event would record details of the attendees, including their address, and using some fancy Rails plugins, render a Google Map with pins identifying the locations of the attendees.
\n
\nThe workshop initially lasted 2 hours, and this was spent both constructing the application, and describing concepts, such as 'MVC framework', 'client - server architecture', 'html styling', 'data models' and so forth. The girls ate up the information and within the initial 2 hour slot, had each coded up their own version of the webapp, and had their own fully functional maps displayed. Personally, I was impressed at the rate at which these women, some completely new to coding, picked up some very complex concepts. We then broke for lunch, and afterwards returned to the app, where we did some additional styling and tweaking.
\n
\nA series of lightening-talks, similar to the Ignite format, was planned for the afternoon. This included a talk on Getting into Game Development, from Alanna Kelly, a section on the Rails Girls movement itself, from Linda Liukas, a talk on her career experiences, from Ana Maria Valarezo. Yuwei Lin, visiting from Salford University gave a talk on An Ethnography of Women in FLOSS (Free/Libre Open-Source Software, and finally, Mateo Collina gave a very interesting talk on The Internet of Things.
\n
\nSome people took the opportunity to do some last minute bug-hunting, or polishing of apps, slowly the visibly elated attendees made their way... their newly empowered way, home. Home, no doubt, to boast of their new found skills to friends and family. Later that evening, mentors were joined by some of the participants for a few well deserved drinks and live music, courtesy of Munroe's bar.
