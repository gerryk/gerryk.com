Ok, I know the title is probably triggering spam filters all over.
Most people have heard of;<a href=http://www.gutenberg.org/>Project Gutenberg</a>, or, if not, they should have. Now we have the same for tech books.
Pete Millet has devoted some of his spare time to scanning and otherwise digitising technical books on which the copyright has lapsed. Thanks a lot Pete.
